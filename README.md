# Conway's Game of Life

Browser-based version of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) using
the PhaserJS JavaScript game framework.

## Background

This demonstration is more for visualization and experimentation with the PhaserJS JavaScript
library. It is intended to be an implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

## How to Use

In order to launch the visualization, simply download/clone the repository to a location on your
local computer and then open the "index.html" file in a modern browser of your choice (Google
Chrome works well for this). You will then see Conway's Game of Life display and animate.
